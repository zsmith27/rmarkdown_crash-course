##	Compile the Document

To view the html document, you must compile the document using Knit. The easiest way to knit a document is to navigate to and click on the Knit button (it looks like a ball of yarn) in the toolbar above the editor window. If a window appears saying “Install Required Packages” for R Markdown, install the necessary packages for knitting the document. The compiled file will be saved in the same directory as your Rmd file (your R Markdown file). I store the R Markdown file(s) in a sub-directory labeled “rmarkdown” within the R-project folder (rproject/markdown), which prevents the project directory from becoming cluttered.

## Your Turn

1. Create a new HTML Rmd file.
2. Save the document to the "rmarkdown/sections" folder.
3. Knit the default document produced by RStudio.
