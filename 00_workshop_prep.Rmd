## Updating Software and Packages

### R

For Windows Operating Systems, run the following code in the RGui, __NOT__ in RStudio. The RGui should be installed when you install R. On my Windows machine, I access RGui by clicking on the R program file-- my current file name is "R x64 3.6.2".

</center>

Once you have the RGui open, copy and paste the R code below into the R Console window. Make sure R Studio is closed before running this code within the RGui. Hit enter once to install the __installr__ package. Hit enter a second time to run the __installer__ package function `updateR()` and follow the instructions.

This code was copied from: https://www.r-statistics.com/2013/03/updating-r-from-r-on-windows-using-the-installr-package/). 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# installing/loading the package:
if(!require(installr)) {
