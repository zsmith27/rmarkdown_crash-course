# Conclusions

1. The relative abundance of Diptera taxa (`pct_diptera`) decreases as the median substrate size (`substrate_size_d50`) increases.
2. Taxonomic richness differed between all lakes. Onondaga lake had the lowest taxonomic richness, while taxonomic richness was greatest in Cazenovia Lake.
