Markdown is a markup language for developing and formatting documents. R Markdown is an R-package that allows the user to integrate text, R-code, and R-code output into a well formatted document (e.g., HTML, MS Word, PDF).

My recommendation is to create an R Markdown file for every R-project. The intention is to document as much of the project as possible.  R Markdown provides a more readable document, with better descriptions of how and why an activity was performed, than a standard R script with a few commented lines. 

## Benefits

* __Reproducible:__ Document steps of an investigation or scientific study

## Basic Overview

Use markdown syntax, some of which is shown in the table below, to format the document.

Once the document is complete (formatted with markdown syntax with integrated R code) the document can be knit (rendered) using the package __knitr__.

Here is a simple example showing the raw R Markdown (Rmd) file before knitting (rendering) and after knitting. The colors on the far left are there to help identify elements pre- and post-knitting.
